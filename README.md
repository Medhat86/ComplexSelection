# ComplexSelection
This repository houses code and data to identify selection on traits controlled by many loci. The corresponding manuscript, "a simple test identifies selection on complex traits in breeding and experimentally evolved populations", is available at [insert bioarxiv link here]. In this repository, we have divided files into subdirectories as outlined below. The majority of analysis code is in the form of R-markdown scripts, for which both raw files and html output have been deposited.

## **Function:** R function to estimate G-hat from allele frequency and effect size data.
**Ghat.R: ** R function to estimate G-hat from allele frequency and effect size data.

## Code to run and analyze simulations code


## Maize: Code to analyze maize data
**Frequency_change_rrBlup_reverseInlay.Rmd:** Code to calculate allele frequencies, estimate effects, and run analysis on maize data.

**Frequency_change_rrBlup_reverseInlay.html:** HTML-readable output.

**ld_calc_maize_03.r:** Code to calculate LD decay in maize data.


## Code to analyze chicken data
