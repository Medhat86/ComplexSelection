# ComplexSelection
This repository houses code and data to identify selection on traits controlled by many loci. The corresponding manuscript, "a simple test identifies selection on complex traits in breeding and experimentally evolved populations", is available at [insert bioarxiv link here]. In this repository, we have divided files into subdirectories as outlined below. The majority of analysis code is in the form of R-markdown scripts, for which both raw files and html output have been deposited.
